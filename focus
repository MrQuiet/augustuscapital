                                	<p>IDG CAPITAL’S ANALYIS<br />
                                	Farfetch had the potential to become the leading fashion marketplace in several key regions, including Europe and the U.S. because of its innovative technology, business model and strong management team. Although the company was relatively unknown in China, it had a huge opportunity there, because of the country’s rapid growth in fashion consumption and a dramatic shift from offline to online purchases. We recognized that Farfetch could become the leading source of information about overseas fashion brands in China, while also providing the largest global inventory of luxury fashion products to Chinese consumers.</p>

                                	<p>IDG CAPITAL’S ACTION PLAN<br />
                                	IDG Capital encouraged Farfetch to invest more resources in China, which led the company to enlarge its team in Shanghai. We helped Farfetch set effective business goals and aided it with recruitment, business relationships and strategic partnerships.</p>

                                	<p>RESULT<br />
                                	During IDG Capital’s involvement with Farfetch, its valuation increased dramatically.&nbsp;</p>
